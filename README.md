# Investigate associated patterns between Bitcoin Search and Price

## About
* Google Trends give us an estimate of search volume. Let's explore if search popularity relates to cryptocurrency prices. For this project, I will investigate whether there are related patterns between Google Search Trend and the price of Bitcoin - the most famous cryptocurrency.

* This project is about data exploration and visualisation using Python. In this project, I use Pandas and Matplotlib library to handle 6-year period data collected from websites:

1. [Google Search Trend](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore)
2. [Yahoo Finance for Bitcoin Price](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/BTC-USD/history?p=BTC-USD)

## Dependencies:

1. Python v3.x is required.
2. Pandas library is required to read and handle the data.
3. Matplotlib library is required to visualise the data.
