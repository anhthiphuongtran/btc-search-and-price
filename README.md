# Investigate associated patterns between Bitcoin Search and Price

## About
* Google Trends give us an estimate of search volume. Let's explore if search popularity relates to cryptocurrency prices. For this project, I will investigate whether there are related patterns between Google Search Trend and the price of Bitcoin - the most famous cryptocurrency.

* This project is about data exploration and visualisation using Python. In this project, I use Pandas and Matplotlib library to handle 6-year period data collected from websites:

1. [Google Search Trend](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore)
2. [Yahoo Finance for Bitcoin Price](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/BTC-USD/history?p=BTC-USD)

## Dependencies:

1. Python v3.x is required.
2. Pandas library is required to read and handle the data.
3. Matplotlib library is required to visualise the data.

* Comments:

As can be seen, the movements of BTC price are clearly associated with movements BTC Search Trend. It seems that everyone was talking about Bitcoin in late 2017/early 2018 so search volumes were at a record high! However, after that, the Google search interest for BTC quickly plunged. Similarly, Bitcoin price spent most of 2018 in a downtrend, falling throughout the year, following a brief surge to start the year. Both BTC price and Google Search Trend were at low levels during 2019 and early 2020, despite some small associated fluctations.

The cryptocurrency climbed to start the year 2021, peaking around $60,000 in April, accompanied by a huge increased interest in BTC Search during this time. After a fall in both BTC price and search by mid-2021, both figures rise again by the end of 2021, though this time BTC price reached its new peak but BTC search number only increased to over 50.

After the all-time high in November 2021, BTC price dropped gradually to January 2023 and then slightly recovered from that onwards. It is clear that BTC search trends moved very closely with the movement of BTC Prices, both in up and down.
